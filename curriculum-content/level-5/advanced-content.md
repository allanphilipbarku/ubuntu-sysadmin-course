# Level 5: Advanced Integration and Automation
**Duration**: Weeks 9-10 | **Focus**: Complex system integration and automation

## Learning Objectives
- Automate system administration tasks with scripts and configuration management
- Integrate multiple services into cohesive infrastructure solutions
- Implement advanced monitoring, alerting, and incident response systems
- Lead infrastructure projects and mentor other team members

## Week 9: Automation and Configuration Management

### Core Tasks

#### 5.1 Automation and Scripting
**Tasks**:
- Write comprehensive bash scripts for common administrative tasks
- Set up sophisticated cron jobs and scheduled maintenance
- Create system health check scripts with automated remediation
- Implement error handling and logging in automation scripts

#### 5.2 Configuration Management and Infrastructure as Code
**Tasks**:
- Use Ansible, Puppet, or Chef for configuration management
- Create playbooks and manifests for system setup and maintenance
- Implement infrastructure as code practices
- Version control configurations and track changes
- Set up automated deployment pipelines

## Week 10: Advanced Monitoring and Final Projects

### Core Tasks

#### 5.3 Advanced Monitoring and Incident Response
**Tasks**:
- Set up enterprise monitoring solutions (Nagios, Zabbix, Prometheus)
- Configure sophisticated alerting with escalation procedures
- Create custom monitoring checks and metrics collection
- Implement log aggregation and analysis (ELK stack)
- Develop incident response procedures and documentation

## Final Project Scenarios

### Scenario 5.1: Complete Infrastructure Deployment
**Challenge**: Deploy a complete multi-tier application infrastructure
**Requirements**:
- Deploy multi-service application (web server, database, cache, load balancer)
- Configure high availability and failover mechanisms
- Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Set up automated backups and disaster recovery procedures
- Create documentation and operational procedures

### Scenario 5.2: Disaster Recovery Simulation
**Challenge**: Test and validate disaster recovery procedures
**Requirements**:
- Simulate various failure scenarios (hardware, network, service failures)
- Test backup and recovery procedures under time pressure
- Document incident response procedures and lessons learned
- Improve systems based on testing results
- Train team members on emergency procedures

### Scenario 5.3: Infrastructure Debugging Challenge
**Challenge**: Inherit a broken system with multiple interconnected issues
**Requirements**:
- Systematically diagnose complex multi-service problems
- Fix boot issues, network connectivity problems, and service dependencies
- Resolve performance bottlenecks and resource conflicts
- Implement preventive measures and monitoring
- Document troubleshooting methodology and solutions

## Deliverables
- Automated infrastructure deployment solution
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting system
- Tested disaster recovery plan with procedures
- Complex troubleshooting documentation and methodology
- Infrastructure as code implementation with version control

## Assessment Criteria
- Can design and implement complex automated infrastructure solutions
- Demonstrates systematic approach to debugging multi-service issues
- Creates effective monitoring, alerting, and incident response procedures
- Shows leadership in infrastructure projects and knowledge sharing
- Contributes to system architecture decisions and best practices
