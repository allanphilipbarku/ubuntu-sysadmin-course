## üîç Peer Review Guidelines

### As a Reviewer

#### What to Look For
- **Correctness**: Does the solution work as intended?

- **Quality**: Is the code/documentation well-structured?
- **Learning**: Does the student demonstrate understanding?
- **Best Practices**: Are security and efficiency considered?

#### How to Provide Feedback
- **Be constructive and specific**: Instead of "This is wrong," say "Consider using `systemctl status` to check service state"
- **Suggest improvements**: Offer alternative approaches or optimizations
- **Ask questions**: Help the student think deeper about their solution
- **Highlight strengths**: Acknowledge good practices and creative solutions
- **Provide resources**: Share helpful links or documentation

#### Review Template
```markdown
## Overall Assessment
