## üéØ Overview

As a student in this collaborative learning environment, you'll need to:

- **Fork** the main repository to your GitHub account
- **Clone** your fork to work locally
- **Stay synchronized** with new task releases from teachers
- **Preserve your work** while pulling upstream changes
- **Submit** your solutions via Pull Requests

### Repository Structure
```
Main Repo (upstream) ‚Üê Teacher releases new tasks
     ‚Üì (you sync)
Your Fork (origin) ‚Üê Your personal copy on GitHub
     ‚Üì (you clone)
Local Copy ‚Üê Where you do your work
```

## üöÄ Initial Setup

### Step 1: Fork the Repository

1. **Go to the main repository** on GitHub
2. **Click "Fork"** in the top-right corner
3. **Select your account** as the destination
4. **Wait for the fork** to be created

### Step 2: Clone Your Fork

```bash
# Clone your fork (replace YOUR-USERNAME)
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/ubuntu-sysadmin-project.git
cd ubuntu-sysadmin-project
```

### Step 3: Add Upstream Remote

This is **crucial** - it allows you to pull new tasks from the teacher's repository:

```bash
# Add the original repository as 'upstream'
git remote add upstream https://github.com/TEACHER-ORG/ubuntu-sysadmin-project.git

# Verify your remotes
git remote -v
# Should show:
# origin    https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/ubuntu-sysadmin-project.git (fetch)
# origin    https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/ubuntu-sysadmin-project.git (push)
# upstream  https://github.com/TEACHER-ORG/ubuntu-sysadmin-project.git (fetch)
# upstream  https://github.com/TEACHER-ORG/ubuntu-sysadmin-project.git (push)
```

### Step 4: Create Your Student Branch

```bash
# Create and switch to your personal branch
git checkout -b student-YOUR-USERNAME

# Push your branch to your fork
git push -u origin student-YOUR-USERNAME
```

### Step 5: Set Up Your Submissions Directory

```bash
# Create your submission directories
mkdir -p submissions/YOUR-USERNAME/{level-1,level-2,level-3,level-4,level-5}

# Add a README to identify your work
cat > submissions/YOUR-USERNAME/README.md << EOF
# Submissions by YOUR-USERNAME

This directory contains my learning journey through the Ubuntu System Administration course.

EOF

# Commit your initial setup
git add submissions/YOUR-USERNAME/
git commit -m "Initial setup: Create student submission directory"
git push origin student-YOUR-USERNAME
```

## üìÖ Daily Workflow

### Morning Routine (5 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Switch to your student branch
git checkout student-YOUR-USERNAME

# 2. Check for new releases from teachers
git fetch upstream

# 3. See what's new (optional)
git log --oneline upstream/main ^HEAD

# 4. Pull new changes if available
git pull upstream main

# 5. Push updates to your fork
git push origin student-YOUR-USERNAME
```

### Working on Tasks

```bash
# 1. Ensure you're on your branch
git checkout student-YOUR-USERNAME

# 2. Work on your tasks in submissions/YOUR-USERNAME/
# Edit files, create scripts, document your learning

# 3. Commit your work frequently
git add submissions/YOUR-USERNAME/level-1/week-1/
git commit -m "Level 1 Week 1: Complete file system exploration

- Added system inventory script
- Documented directory relationships
- Created configuration analysis"

# 4. Push your work to your fork
git push origin student-YOUR-USERNAME
```

## üîÑ Pulling Upstream Changes

### When Teachers Release New Tasks

You'll receive notifications when new tasks are available. Here's how to get them:

#### Method 1: Simple Pull (Recommended for Beginners)

```bash
# Ensure you're on your branch
git checkout student-YOUR-USERNAME

# Fetch the latest from upstream
git fetch upstream

# Pull changes from upstream main into your branch
git pull upstream main

# Push the updated branch to your fork
git push origin student-YOUR-USERNAME
```

#### Method 2: Rebase (For Advanced Users)

```bash
# Fetch the latest changes
git fetch upstream

# Rebase your work on top of upstream changes
git rebase upstream/main

# Force push (only to your own branch!)
git push --force-with-lease origin student-YOUR-USERNAME
```

### Checking for New Releases

```bash
# Script to check for new task releases
#!/bin/bash
# save as check-updates.sh

echo "Checking for new task releases..."

# Fetch latest from upstream
git fetch upstream

# Check for new commits in levels/ directory
NEW_RELEASES=$(git log --oneline --since="1 week ago" upstream/main -- levels/ | wc -l)

if [ "$NEW_RELEASES" -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "üéâ New task releases available!"
    echo "Recent releases:"
    git log --oneline --since="1 week ago" upstream/main -- levels/
    echo ""
    echo "Run 'git pull upstream main' to get the new tasks"
else
    echo "‚úÖ You're up to date with all released tasks"
fi
```

## üö® Handling Conflicts

### Understanding Conflicts

Conflicts happen when:
- You've modified a file that was also updated upstream
- Git can't automatically merge the changes
- **Most common**: When README.md or shared files are edited

### Resolving Conflicts Step by Step

#### When you see conflict markers:

```bash
# After pulling, you might see:
# Auto-merging levels/level-1-foundation/week-1/README.md
# CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in levels/level-1-foundation/week-1/README.md
# Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

#### Step 1: Identify Conflicted Files
```bash
# See which files have conflicts
git status

# Should show files under "Unmerged paths"
```

#### Step 2: Open and Resolve Conflicts
```bash
# Open the conflicted file in your editor
nano levels/level-1-foundation/week-1/README.md

# You'll see conflict markers like:
<<<<<<< HEAD
# Your version of the content
=======
# Upstream version of the content
>>>>>>> upstream/main
```

#### Step 3: Choose the Resolution
For **task files** (like README.md in levels/), usually keep the upstream version:
```markdown
# Keep the upstream version (teacher's latest content)
# Delete your changes if they conflict with task instructions
```

For **your submission files**, keep your work:
```markdown
# Keep your work in submissions/YOUR-USERNAME/
# These should never conflict since they're your personal files
```

#### Step 4: Complete the Merge
```bash
# After editing the file to resolve conflicts:
git add levels/level-1-foundation/week-1/README.md

# Commit the merge
git commit -m "Merge upstream changes: Level 1 Week 1 task updates"

# Push to your fork
git push origin student-YOUR-USERNAME
```

### Avoiding Conflicts

#### Golden Rules:
1. **Never edit files in `levels/`** - these contain task instructions
2. **Only work in `submissions/YOUR-USERNAME/`** - this is your space
3. **Pull upstream changes before starting new work**
4. **Commit your work frequently** to avoid losing progress

#### Safe Workflow:
```bash
# Before starting work each day:
git fetch upstream
git pull upstream main

# Work only in your directory:
cd submissions/YOUR-USERNAME/
# Do your work here

# Commit and push regularly:
git add submissions/YOUR-USERNAME/
git commit -m "Descriptive message about your work"
git push origin student-YOUR-USERNAME
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: "fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories"

**Solution:**
```bash
git pull upstream main --allow-unrelated-histories
```

#### Issue: "error: Your local changes would be overwritten by merge"

**Solution:**
```bash
# If the changes are in your submission directory, stash them:
git stash push -m "Saving my work" submissions/YOUR-USERNAME/

# Pull the updates
git pull upstream main

# Restore your work
git stash pop
```

#### Issue: "error: failed to push some refs"

**Solution:**
```bash
# If your fork is behind, fetch and merge first:
git fetch origin
git merge origin/student-YOUR-USERNAME

# Then try pushing again:
git push origin student-YOUR-USERNAME
```

#### Issue: Accidentally worked in the wrong directory

**Solution:**
```bash
# If you accidentally edited files in levels/, reset them:
git checkout upstream/main -- levels/

# Then move your work to the right place:
mkdir -p submissions/YOUR-USERNAME/level-X/week-Y/
# Copy your work to the submissions directory
# Then commit it properly
```

### Emergency Recovery

#### If you're completely stuck:

1. **Backup your work:**
   ```bash
   cp -r submissions/YOUR-USERNAME ~/backup-my-work-$(date +%Y%m%d)
   ```

2. **Start fresh:**
   ```bash
   cd ..
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/ubuntu-sysadmin-project.git fresh-clone
   cd fresh-clone
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/TEACHER-ORG/ubuntu-sysadmin-project.git
   git fetch upstream
   git checkout -b student-YOUR-USERNAME
   git pull upstream main
   ```

3. **Restore your work:**
   ```bash
   cp -r ~/backup-my-work-*/YOUR-USERNAME submissions/
   git add submissions/YOUR-USERNAME/
   git commit -m "Restore my work after fresh clone"
   git push -u origin student-YOUR-USERNAME
   ```
